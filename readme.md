Harmonic drive

Lessons:
Wave generator must push the middle of the teeth
The outer gear must not deform
Flexspline must not get stuck in oter gear
Flexspline must not be too flexible or else the teeth will not come out of the outer gear
More oval flexgear
Smaller teeth
Motor mounting hub modification for wave generator


Ratios:
FlexSpline Output
Flexspline teeth: 200
Circular Spline Teeth: 202
Ratio = 200/200-202 = -100:1
Output rotation opposite input rotation
